# Project Name: Msafiri

## Overview
Msafiri is a microservice-based project developed using Spring Boot, Docker, Grafana, and other related technologies. It aims to provide a scalable and efficient solution for managing various aspects of a travel application.

The project follows a microservice architecture, which allows breaking down the application into smaller, independent services that can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently. Each microservice focuses on a specific functionality or domain, enabling better maintainability, scalability, and fault isolation.

## Technologies Used
- **Spring Boot**: Spring Boot is used as the core framework for building the microservices. It provides a streamlined development experience, auto-configuration, and easy integration with other Spring projects.

- **Docker**: Docker is used for containerization, allowing the microservices to be packaged along with their dependencies into lightweight and isolated containers. This simplifies deployment and ensures consistency across different environments.

- **Grafana**: Grafana is utilized for monitoring and visualization of system metrics, performance, and logs. It helps in gaining insights into the behavior of the microservices, identifying bottlenecks, and troubleshooting issues.

## Key Features
- **Microservice Architecture**: The project follows a microservice architecture, which promotes modularity, scalability, and fault tolerance. Each microservice can be developed, tested, deployed, and scaled independently, enabling agility and flexibility.

- **Travel Application**: Msafiri focuses on managing various aspects of a travel application. This may include functionalities such as user registration and authentication, flight booking, hotel reservations, trip planning, and more.

- **RESTful APIs**: The microservices expose RESTful APIs to communicate with each other and external clients. These APIs provide a standardized interface for interacting with the different services and accessing their functionalities.

- **Containerization**: Docker is used to containerize the microservices, ensuring that they can run consistently across different environments. This simplifies deployment, improves scalability, and enhances portability.

- **Monitoring and Visualization**: Grafana is integrated into the project to monitor the performance and health of the microservices. It provides real-time insights into system metrics, logs, and other relevant data, enabling efficient troubleshooting and optimization.
